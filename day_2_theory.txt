Q.6 What are Constants(Data Types) and how all works?
	=>	Constants are those values which are never going to be changed they remain static 
		once defined.
		e.g: 1 , 'a', 'sentence', 2.32154 etc.

	=> There are total 3 types of Constants: 
		1> Integer
		2> Float
		3> String

	=>	Rules for constructing Integer Constants:
		-> Integers must not written inside Quotes''
		-> Integers must not contain any decimal point.
		-> Integers must have atleast one digit.
		e.g: 1, 231, 0, -1

	=>	Rules for constructing Float Constants:
		-> Floats must not written inside Quotes''
		-> Floats must contain decimal point.
		-> Floats must have atleast one digit with one decimal point.
		e.g: 1.0, 231.235, 0.0, -1.2641546876876

	=> Rules for constructing String Constants:
		-> String must written inside Quotes''
		-> String atleast have one charachter.
		e.g: '1', "This is demo sentence.", 'c', "-1 + 2"

	Mostly in python constants are the things which are going to displayed over screen or they might 
	be values as parameter of your function which we will look later in this course.

Q.7 What are Variables and how all works?
	=>	Variables are dynamic values which are going to be changed as per situation or condition has
		occours during execution of programe.

	=> 	Simply they store values in themselves.

	=>	They are like containers which will going to store any value within themselves 
		used in our code for better understanding of code and to imporve our code's readabilty and making it more English friendly.

		Syntax : <Variable_Name> = <Variable_Value> 		//Grammer for defining a variable.
			
			e.g: my_variable = 'Some Value'

	=>	Rules for constructing Varables:
		-> Variable name must not start with any integer
		-> Variable name must contain any space.
		-> Variable name must not contain any special charachter excepting underscore '_'
		-> Variable name must be on left side and value must be on right side.
		-> Variable name can be anything excepting preseved keywords.
	
	=> Benifits of variable:
		-> Variable can reduce size of code.
		-> Variable imporves our code's readabilty.
		-> Variable help us to manage & access our data in more productive way

	=> Variable can contain any value like: 1> String
											2> Integers
											3> Floats
											4> Functions
											5> Classes

Q.8 What is comment and how all works?
	=> Comments are lines which will never be compiled by our compiler python has nothing to do with
		it. they used inside code for giving understanding of our thoughts behind that code.

	=> There are 2 types of comment:
		1> Single Line Comment
		2> Multiline Comment

	1> Single Line Comment:
		-> They can be placed anywhere within the code using '#' symbol if you put hash-symbol before
			any line it will become a single line comment.

			e.g : # This is a single line comment.

	2> Multiline Comment:
		-> They need to be placed in new line every time you use it and they can be accessed by 
			(''' ''') Triple quotes starting and Triple quotes ending it nesscary to end Triple
			quotes as well.
