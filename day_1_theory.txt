									Python Programming
																	Day 1

Q.1 What is Programming?
	=> Programming is process of making programs.
		
		Program : Program is just well organised set of instructions.
		Instruction : Our Thoughts in form of conditions to get disired output.

Q.2 Why we need to do Programming?
	=> Programming is superpower today which give us capabilities of 
		making automation in daily tasks,
		making Gui Application,
		making Web Application,
		making Mobile Application,
		making Robotic Stuff (Arduino,Rasberry Pi etc.),
		.... other reseach stuff also .......

Q.3 How to do Programming?
	=> To do programming we need first of all programming language installed in our pc,
		(in our case it python) Just like any software we install in pc.
		
	=>By installing python in pc we are actually installing syntax of python 
		programming language.

		Syntax : Grammer of programming language.

Q.4 Where to do Programming?
	=> Once we have installed a programming language in our pc we can write our 
		code in any text-editor(notepade, wordpad) like software already installed in our pc or	we can use python's own console to write a code.

	#IMPORTANT
		Here extension plays a big role you must have to save your code with
		specific extension only in our case we ".py".

		Extenstion : Indicates type of File.
			e.g : file1.txt <------ text file
			e.g : file2.py <------ python file

	There are other Third party text-editor available in market made only for
	coding with functionalities like syntax highlighting etc..

	My suggestion:  Sublime Text-Editor 3
					VS-CODE
					PyCharm

//TODO//////Now we will install both python programming language & Sublime 3 in your pc.

Q.5 What we are going to write in our code?
	=>  Constants:
				- Integers
				- Float
				- String
		Variables:
				- Global
				- Local
		Opreators:
				- Arithmatic Opreators (+,-,*,/)
				- Assignment Opreators (=)
				- Relational Opreators (>, <, ==, >=, <=, !=)
				- Logical Opreators ( and, or, not)
				- Bitwise Opreators (True, False)
		Pre-define Functions and Self-made Functions: print() etc..
		Class: we look later ....
